## Generations

- **First Generation (2024-present)**: The Land Cruiser returned to the North American market for 2024 after a two-year hiatus, now exclusively featuring Toyota's i-FORCE MAX hybrid powertrain. Based on the J250 series platform (marketed as Land Cruiser Prado in other markets), this generation represents a shift to a mid-size two-row SUV with five-seat capacity, replacing the full-size three-row J200 series. The hybrid system combines a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor, producing 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque through an eight-speed automatic transmission. It achieves an EPA-estimated 23 mpg combined with a 6,000-pound towing capacity.

  Built on Toyota's TNGA-F platform shared with the Tundra and Tacoma, the Land Cruiser features standard full-time four-wheel drive with locking center and rear differentials. The design takes a retro-inspired approach with boxy styling and heritage elements, available in two main trims: Land Cruiser 1958 (with round LED headlights and "TOYOTA" grille) and Land Cruiser (with rectangular headlights). Standard features include Multi-Terrain Select, CRAWL Control, and Toyota Safety Sense.

  The 2024 model year launched with a limited First Edition trim (5,000 units for North America). For 2025, the First Edition was discontinued with no other significant changes. The 2026 model year adds a monotone Heritage Blue paint option with modest price increases but no mechanical updates.
